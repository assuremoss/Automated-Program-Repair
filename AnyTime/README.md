Abstract: "Current evaluations of automatic program repair
(APR) techniques focus on toolsâ€™ effectiveness, while little is
known about the practical aspects of using APR tools, such as
how long one should wait for a tool to generate a bug fix. In
this work, we empirically study whether APR tools are any time
algorithms (e.g., the more time they have, the more fixes they
generate, so it makes sense to trade off longer time for better
quality). Our preliminary experiment shows that the amount of
plausible patches, given exponentially greater time, only increases
linearly or not at all."
