## Our aim is to run the APR tools with AnyTime algorithm on vulnerable programs:
- [Juliet Java dataset](https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/testsuite.php).
  - Number of CWEs: 112
  - Build tools: Ant

## RepairThemAll
- Our fork of RepairThemAll: [RepairThemAll](https://github.com/vuduclyunitn/RepairThemAll)

## Current Progress:
- [x] Build Juliet programs successfully
- [ ] Integreate the build tool Ant into RepairThemAll
- [x] Build a single test case sucessfully. To build a test case, we use **javac**, a test case, and a list of testcasse support files
